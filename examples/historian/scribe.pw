            1. **Read the master diff** (use Read tool):
            - Read `${work_dir}/master.diff`
            - Identify which changes belong to this commit based on the description

            2. **Analyze commit size**:
            - If the commit would include >15 files or >500 lines, use the Ask tool to ask the user how to split it
            - Otherwise, proceed with creating the commit

            3. **Validate the build**:
            - The build command is ${build_command}
            - If the build command is null, skip this build validation step.
            - Otherwise:
            do {
                for var i in 1...3 {
                    log("Running build validation (attempt ${i})")

                        var suggestion = ask {
                            The build is failing after 3 attempts to fix it automatically.

                            Latest error output:

                            I've tried applying these changes:
                            [describe what you applied in each attempt]

                            What should I do to make the build pass?
                        }

                        if $? != 0 {
                            log("User suggestion failed to fix build")
                            narrator.send({

                                error: "User suggestion failed to fix build (see ${work_dir}/build-output.log)"
                            })
                            throw "Build failure"

                            - Use **Read tool** to examine `${work_dir}/build-output.log` for errors
                            - Use **Read tool** to examine `${work_dir}/master.diff` for potential fixes
                            - Identify missing changes (imports, types, fields, etc.)
                            - Apply fixes using **Write/Edit** tools
                            - Amend: `git add -A && git commit --amend --no-edit`
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

            4. **Create the commit**:
            - Use Write/Edit tools to apply the changes, OR
            - Use `git apply` with extracted diff hunks
            - Then commit:
            {
                $ git commit -m "${description}                                 \
                                                                                \
