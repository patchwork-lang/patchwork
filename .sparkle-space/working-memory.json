  "currentFocus": "MAJOR SIMPLIFICATION: Eliminated IdentifierCall token! Parser is now cleaner and more standard.",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Removed IdentifierCall token from lexer completely",
    "Removed bare command syntax (identifier args) from parser",
    "Implemented standard function call parsing: identifier '(' args ')'",
    "Verified all example files use explicit $ prefix (no bare commands found)",
    "Removed 2 obsolete tests for bare commands without $ prefix",
    "Fixed 2 lexer tests to expect Identifier + LParen instead of IdentifierCall",
    "All tests passing: 57/57 lexer, 93/95 parser (2 known issues)",
    "main.pw and narrator.pw still parse correctly ✅",
    "Updated workarounds.md: removed #3, moved to Historical Workarounds",
    "Active workarounds reduced from 4 to 3"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Commit the simplification",
    "Decide on next direction: more parser work OR move to semantic analysis",
    "Consider: fixing remaining lexer issues (span tracking, multi-line prompts)",
    "Alternative: Move forward with interpreter/type checker"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Excellent call! Your insight to eliminate IdentifierCall was spot-on. We removed a complex workaround by making all shell commands explicit with $. The parser is now simpler, more standard, and the longest-match issue is completely gone.",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Explicit prefixes eliminate ambiguity - no whitespace sensitivity needed",
    "Example files already used $ prefix everywhere - zero changes needed!",
    "IdentifierCall was attempting to solve ambiguity via lexer longest-match",
    "Better solution: require explicit syntax ($) and use standard grammar",
    "Function calls now work uniformly: f(x) and f (x) both valid",
    "Keywords work without spacing: while(true) now parses correctly",
    "Removed technical debt and complexity for simpler, cleaner design",
    "3 active workarounds remain (2 with solutions, 1 just comment style)",
    "Test count: 93/95 parser (2 known failures), 57/57 lexer",
    "Design principle: Explicit syntax beats implicit disambiguation"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "Major simplification complete - IdentifierCall removed entirely",
    "All shell commands now require explicit $ prefix (clearer intent)",
    "Parser uses standard LR(1) function call parsing",
    "No longer fighting with lexer longest-match rules",
    "Example files unchanged - they already followed best practices",
    "Workarounds reduced: 4 → 3 active (span tracking, defensive checks, comment style)",
    "2 known unfixed issues remain: UTF-8 span tracking, multi-line prompts",
    "Parser is production-ready for files like main.pw and narrator.pw",
    "Trade-off accepted: require $ prefix for cleaner parser design"
