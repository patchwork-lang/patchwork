{
  "currentFocus": "Completed syntactic changes to Patchwork parser: task→agent, added trait/default/await keywords",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Eliminated 'task' keyword, added 'agent' keyword for agent declarations",
    "Added 'trait' keyword with full TraitDecl support for trait Name { methods } syntax",
    "Added 'default' keyword as optional export modifier (export default agent/skill/fun/trait)",
    "Implemented postfix .await syntax (expr.await) matching Rust style",
    "Removed prefix await syntax, keeping only postfix form",
    "Renamed PostfixAwait to Await (simplified since only one variant)",
    "Updated all AST structures with is_default: bool field",
    "All 105 parser tests passing",
    "analyst.pw successfully parses with 'export default agent analyst(...)'"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Consider implementing parameter type annotations (description: string)",
    "Consider implementing throw statements",
    "Consider implementing tuple destructuring",
    "Consider implementing do/else patterns",
    "Parser ready for semantic analysis or interpreter work"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Clean feature implementation complete - all syntactic changes successful",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Grammar rule ordering matters in LALRPOP - .await must come before general member access to avoid ambiguity",
    "Removed 'await' from ObjectKey list to prevent conflicts with .await special syntax",
    "trait declarations use head/tail pattern to avoid grammar ambiguity with newlines",
    "All declarations (agent, skill, fun, trait) now support both export and default modifiers"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "Some historian examples still have parse errors due to unimplemented features (not our changes)",
    "Parameter type annotations not yet supported",
    "throw statements not yet implemented",
    "spawn() function is library code (not special syntax)"
  ]
