{
  "currentFocus": "Export syntax implementation complete",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Added 'export' keyword to lexer and parser",
    "Extended AST nodes (SkillDecl, TaskDecl, FunctionDecl) with is_exported field",
    "Updated parser grammar to support optional export prefix on declarations",
    "Enhanced AST dump to display export status",
    "Added 5 comprehensive tests for export syntax (all passing)",
    "Verified all historian examples parse correctly with export declarations",
    "Full test suite passing: 118 tests (up from 113)"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Parser feature-complete with export syntax matching import",
    "Ready for next phase: AST visitors, pretty printer, semantic analysis, or interpreter",
    "Consider documenting export syntax in parser-design.md"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Clean implementation complete - export syntax mirrors import elegantly",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Optional grammar pattern: <is_exported:\"export\"?> captures presence cleanly",
    "Boolean flag in AST (is_exported) simpler than separate exported/non-exported variants",
    "AST dump prefix pattern keeps output readable",
    "Test coverage ensures both exported and non-exported declarations work correctly"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "Export syntax is optional - declarations work with or without it",
    "All three declaration types support export: task, skill, fun",
    "Historian examples use export for top-level entry points",
    "Parser token, lexer rule, and adapter all need synchronization for new keywords"
