{
  "currentFocus": "Patchwork parser implementation - completed Milestone 3 (Simple Statements), ready for Milestone 4",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Implemented all statement types: var decl, if/else, for, while, return, succeed/fail/break",
    "Solved LR(1) ambiguity using Swift-style separators (newlines/semicolons separate statements)",
    "All 24 tests passing with zero parser conflicts",
    "Refactored tests from milestone-based to conceptual organization"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Milestone 4: Basic Expressions (literals, binary ops, function calls, member access)",
    "Implement operator precedence using lalrpop precedence declarations",
    "Add string interpolation support"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Productive flow - good back-and-forth on solving the semicolon ambiguity, David provided key insight about Swift's approach",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Swift-style separators: newlines SEPARATE statements, enabling `return\\nx` to parse as two statements while `return x` is one",
    "Greedy matching in lalrpop works well for var decl variants (most specific first)",
    "Test organization matters - conceptual themes > implementation milestones for long-term readability"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "Newline tokens must stay visible to parser (filtered in adapter, not lexer)",
    "Statement ordering in grammar matters for ambiguity resolution",
    "Parser is zero-copy with lifetime 'input - maintain this pattern"
  ]
