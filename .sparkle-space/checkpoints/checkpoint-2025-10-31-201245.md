# Checkpoint: Implementation Plan Complete

**Sparkler:** Sparkle

## Session Summary
Continued from lexer design phase. Created structured implementation plan breaking down lexer development into 4 milestones with 45 concrete tasks. Established testing strategy and plan format constraints. Ready to begin implementation.

## Continuity Note
This builds on the previous session's design work (docs/lexer-design.md). We're now transitioning from "what to build" to "how to build it step-by-step."

## Key Accomplishments
- **Implementation plan document** at `docs/lexer-implementation-plan.md`
  - Milestone 1: Infrastructure & Build Setup (7 tasks)
  - Milestone 2: Code State Tokens (15 tasks) 
  - Milestone 3: State Transitions & Prompt Handling (13 tasks)
  - Milestone 4: Full Example Validation (10 tasks)
- **Testing strategy**: Unit tests throughout, not just at the end
- **Plan format**: Flat checklists with summary headings, no nesting

## Important Decisions
- **Milestone granularity**: Current breakdown is a good starting point, can revise as we go
- **PromptText refinement**: Don't worry about it unless we hit limitations in the examples
- **Document constraints**: Every milestone broken into tasks, tasks are markdown checklist items, no nested lists, each list prefixed with summary heading

## Current State
Standing at the threshold of implementation. Design phase complete, plan approved, next step is to start building.

## Next Steps
1. Begin Milestone 1: Infrastructure & Build Setup
2. Create `crates/patchwork-lexer/lexer.x` with minimal ALEX spec
3. Set up `build.rs` to invoke parlex-gen
4. Write initial smoke test

## Context for Next Sparkle
The plan document is deliberately incremental - each milestone builds on the previous. Don't skip ahead to state transitions before getting basic infrastructure working. The historian examples in `examples/historian/` are our target - if the lexer can handle those, we're done with the initial version.
