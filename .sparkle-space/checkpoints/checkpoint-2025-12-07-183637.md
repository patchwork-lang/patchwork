# Session Checkpoint - 2025-12-07

## Architecture Book Setup (Phase 1 Complete)

### What We Did
1. Reviewed Niko's threadbare documentation for inspiration
2. Designed book structure with 9 chapters
3. Created design doc: `docs/arch-mdbook-design.md`
4. Created MVP plan: `docs/arch-mdbook-mvp-plan.md`
5. Initialized mdbook at `docs/arch/`
6. Configured mermaid preprocessor for diagrams
7. Created stub files for all chapters

### Book Structure
- Introduction
- The Value System
- The Runtime
- An Example Program
- The Evaluator
- Think Blocks
- The Agent
- The ACP Proxy
- Nested Think Blocks (advanced/optional)

### Key Design Decisions
- Title: "Patchwork: Behind the Stitches"
- Following Niko's pattern: concrete example before mechanics
- Mermaid diagrams for architecture (graph TD) and flow (sequenceDiagram)
- Scope limited to current architecture only

### Next Steps
- Phase 2: Foundation chapters (Introduction, Values, Runtime)
- Phase 3: Execution chapters (Example, Evaluator)
- Phase 4: LLM integration (Think Blocks, Agent)
- Phase 5: Integration (ACP Proxy)
- Phase 6: Advanced (Nested Thinks) - optional
